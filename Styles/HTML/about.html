          Anecdote <br> My cousin philly(he's my second cousin) got ran over while 
          he was driving his new car, and his flight got cancelled 
          because of a plane problem so he had to walk home all the way down to transorg. 
          His wheelchair broke and he fell at his house and he got in and
          his dog rubert cooked his smoking hot pumpkin seeds that I bought him 
          last week. He injected it and he got all better!! That led me to create 
          this site to help other people.
